  <p class="bible">2 Timothy 3:12-17 KJV  Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.  (13)  But evil men
  and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.  (14)  But continue thou in the things which thou
  hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;  (15)  And that from a child thou hast
  known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
   (16)  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
  instruction in righteousness:  (17)  That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
  </p>

  <p class="text">We Will suffer persecution.</p>

  <p class="bible">2 Thessalonians 1:3-8 KJV  We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith
  groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;  (4)  So that we ourselves
  glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye
  endure:  (5)  Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom
  of God, for which ye also suffer:  (6)  Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that
  trouble you;  (7)  And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his
  mighty angels,  (8)  In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our
  Lord Jesus Christ:
  </p>

  <p class="bible" >2 Thessalonians 2:1 KJV  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
  together unto him,
</p>

<p class="bible">2 Thessalonians 2:7 KJV  For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be
taken out of the way.
</p>

<p class="bible">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12 KJV  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
 (12)  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
</p>

<p class="text"> When God gave the people the truth they did not love it but they have a form of Godliness but has more love for the pleasure of unrighteousness than righteousness because it does not harmonize with their desires.  </p>

<p class="bible" >Romans 1:18 KJV  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who
hold the truth in unrighteousness;
</p>

<p class="bible">2 Peter 1:19 KJV  We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light
that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
</p>

<p class="bible"> 2 Peter 2:1-9 KJV  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,
who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift
destruction.  (2)  And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken
of.  (3)  And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long
time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.  (4)  For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;  (5)  And spared not the
old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
ungodly;  (6)  And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an
ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;  (7)  And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
the wicked:  (8)  (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day
to day with their unlawful deeds;)  (9)  The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve
the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
</p>

<p class="text"> We tend to follow the broder road than the narrow road because everyone because most people are following the broad road.</p>

<p class="bible"> Romans 1:19-20 KJV  Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.  (20) 
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
</p>

<p class="text"> They reap what they sow and then they ask where is God.
People would also rather say that their is no God because they don't want to let go of sin.
</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 1:28-32 KJV  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  (29)  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  (30)  Backbiters,
haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  (31)  Without
understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  (32)  Who knowing the judgment of
God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do
them.
</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 7:15 KJV  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves.
</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 7:21 KJV  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 7:24-26 KJV  Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise
man, which built his house upon a rock:  (25)  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  (26)  And every one that heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
